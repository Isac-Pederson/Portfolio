# Portfolio
My own website that is desgined to look amazing on desktop, laptop, and mobile. I use bootstrap to make the website scale down.
On all of the pages I also have a navbar so the user can move from page to page. On the portfolio page I show off all of my projects and have a deployed live page as well as a 
github repository page for all of the projects. On the contact page the user can get my phone number, email address, github page, linkedin, and resume. The user can also send me an email through the contact page.
